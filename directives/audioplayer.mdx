title: AudioPlayer Directives
description: Stream long-form audio content with AudioPlayer directives
---

The AudioPlayer interface streams long-form audio (music, podcasts, audiobooks) on all Alexa devices. Unlike SSML or APLA, AudioPlayer keeps audio playing after the skill session ends and supports queue management.

## Play

Sends an audio stream to the device. The `playBehavior` controls how it interacts with the queue.

### Play Behaviors

| Behavior | Description |
|---|---|
| `REPLACE_ALL` | Stop current audio and replace the entire queue |
| `ENQUEUE` | Add to end of current queue (requires `expectedPreviousToken`) |
| `REPLACE_ENQUEUED` | Replace queued items but keep current stream playing |

<Warning>
  All audio stream URLs must use HTTPS. The builder throws an error if a non-HTTPS URL is provided.
</Warning>

## Stop

Stops the currently playing audio stream.

```typescript
import { createAudioPlayerStopDirective } from "alexa-apl-interface";

const directive = createAudioPlayerStopDirective();
// { type: "AudioPlayer.Stop" }
```

## ClearQueue

Clears the audio playback queue.

```typescript
import { createAudioPlayerClearQueueDirective } from "alexa-apl-interface";

// Clear queue but keep current stream playing
const clearQueued = createAudioPlayerClearQueueDirective("CLEAR_ENQUEUED");

// Stop everything and clear the queue
const clearAll = createAudioPlayerClearQueueDirective("CLEAR_ALL");
```

| Behavior | Description |
|---|---|
| `CLEAR_ENQUEUED` | Clear the queue but keep the current stream playing |
| `CLEAR_ALL` | Clear the queue and stop the current stream |

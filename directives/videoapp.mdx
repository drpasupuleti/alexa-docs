description: Play full-screen native video on screen-capable Alexa devices

The VideoApp interface plays full-screen native video on screen-capable devices (Echo Show, Fire TV). Unlike APL video components, VideoApp takes over the entire screen.

## Launch

Starts playing a video in native full-screen mode.

    // Device tries each source in order until it finds one it can play
    const directive = createVideoAppLaunchDirectiveWithSources(
      [
        { url: "https://cdn1.example.com/video.mp4" },
        { url: "https://cdn2.example.com/video.mp4" },

      { title: "My Video", subtitle: "With CDN fallback" }
    );

  <Tab title="Builder Pattern">
    ```typescript
    import { VideoAppLaunchDirectiveBuilder } from "alexa-apl-interface";

    const directive = new VideoAppLaunchDirectiveBuilder()
      .addSource("https://example.com/video-hd.mp4", {
        sizeInBytes: 52428800,
      })
      .addSource("https://example.com/video-sd.mp4", {
        sizeInBytes: 15728640,
      })
      .setTitle("My Video")
      .setSubtitle("Episode 1")
      .build();
    ```

<Warning>
  All video URLs must use HTTPS. The response must not include `shouldEndSession` — the VideoApp interface keeps the session open automatically.
